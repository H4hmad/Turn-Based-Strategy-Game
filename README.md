## Learning Outcomes

- Version Control: Clone a repository and manage project versions using Git.
- Repository Analysis: Examine different repositories on GitHub and Bitbucket to gather information.
- Java Development: Develop Java applications using the Java libraries and object-oriented programming principles.
- User Interface Design: Modify and enhance a Visual Studio Code (VSCode) project to implement specific user interface features.
- Graphics Handling: Utilize the Graphics class from Java libraries to draw complex graphical elements.
- Object-Oriented Design: Refactor code to organize it into meaningful classes and implement structural design patterns like Composite.
- Event Handling: Implement mouse event handling to interact with graphical elements.
- Inheritance and Polymorphism: Utilize inheritance to create subclasses of the Actor class and override methods like paint.
- Exception Handling: Handle file reading exceptions and implement error handling strategies.
- Functional Programming: Use functional interfaces like Consumer and Optional for functional programming techniques.
- Design Patterns: Implement design patterns such as Strategy and Adapter to enhance code structure and functionality.
- Animation Integration: Incorporate external libraries and design patterns to integrate animations into the game environment.
- Jar File Usage: Incorporate external libraries (jar files) into the project using adapter pattern.

  
These learning outcomes cover a wide range of skills including version control, Java development, graphical user interface design, object-oriented design principles, exception handling, and integration of external libraries.
